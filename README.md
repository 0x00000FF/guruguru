GURUGURU is a translation helper extension for YouTube LiveChat. 

## Usage
 * You just click on the desired message, then GURUGURU will translate the message for you.
 * When you need to see original text again, click it again!
 * It surely supports SuperChat!
 * This extension uses [Naver Papago API](https://developers.naver.com/docs/papago/README.md), you need to [register](https://developers.naver.com/apps/#/register) and generate API ID and Key.
 * It's a chrome extension, you can install and use it any chromium based browsers!

## Disclaimer
Since Naver Papago API does not support client side request, so I made mediator and its server (https://ppgmed.patche.me) and I never store your request information at all!

You can check the source code of the mediator from `med-src` directory.
